Conferences
===========

A collection of notes from all the conferences I and my friends have attended.

## Starting a Conference

 - Check if there is a folder for the conference already.
  - I tend to create the folder with the conference name in lower case and underscores for spaces
 - Under the conference folder create another folder for the year or year-quarter depending on how often the conference takes place
 - Within the year folder I normally break each day up into its own folder also
