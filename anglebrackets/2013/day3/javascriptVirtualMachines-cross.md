Javascript, Virtual Machines, and the Cloud
===

Presentor: Scott Hanselman

How Do you describe the internet to someone who has the ability to understand it, but has not been paying attention to what has been happening.

## The Cloud

If your company does not move to the cloud, your company is not going to be around.  The idea of the cloud is just an abstract computer that you can use or not use.  You can create 500 things then just trash them then spin them up again, and you dont know how.

*Note: Ghost*

The cloud should not care about what what language you use, what os you use.  It just cares about CPU cycles.

Demoed creating a batch file that can take in N files and process them and output them in the cloud with just attributes.

## The Browser

Scientist getting their research out to everyone else.  Tiny Virtual machines: java, silverlight, flash.

You already know the cloud, you can program the browser
