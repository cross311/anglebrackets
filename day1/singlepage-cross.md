## Vanilla JS

A javascript framework that is one every single device that exists today!  If you just went *what*, let me explain what vanilla js is.  Vanilla js is the javascript language itself, or js out of the box.  Make sure that what you are doing actually needs a framework, because you can do a lot with out of the box javascript.

## SPAs

Definition: single page application.  Presentor is going to use angularjs as the spa framework for today.  Don't mix frameworks, pick one and stick with it.  Mixing spa frameworks is just asking for a jumbled mess!

Questions that you should ask when choosing a framework:

* What do I need?
* What options do I have?
* What do I need to know?
* What can I build?

If you can't get approval to turn your entire app into spa, just know that you can just do a small section as a spa.  Just phase in the spa, slowly taking in more and more pages that the spa handles.
