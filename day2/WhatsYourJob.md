### On software gurus and claims
####Become a software guru in 9 easy steps
1. Conventional wisdom with a tiwst
2. Name it! "speed", "quality", foreign sounding word
3. Write a book (150+ pages), claim massive savings with unverifiable metrics, make up acronyms for common things. Draw parallels to irrelevant disciplines (construction, manufacturing).
4. Do a manifesto. Make it generic, then claim that your new thing is the only way to be faithful to it. 
5. Do a training course -- steal every exercise you've ever seen, give it new names and construct a week-long curriculum. 
6. Get on the conference circuit! Explain patiently that anyone who doesn't grasp your new thing is an idiot.
7. Write blog posts insulting all the people who have done in the past exactly what you are doing now, plus anyone else who questions your wisdom. "If they tried it, they would get it." 
8. Rake in the dough.
9. When the dough stops flowing, return to Step 1; this time with name recognition!

#### Why does this happen?
- During periods of change, people want answers.
- Most gurus are sincere

> "Industrial process control theory is a proven body of knowledge that describes why Scrum works and other approaches are difficult and finally untenable." --Agile Software Development with Scrum, Ken Schwaber

> "If you need 3-4x as much test code as you need production code, and you need 1-4x as many testers as you need developers...you must SUCK as a coder."

### Unit testing is oversold
- Be passionate about results, not about process
- Corollary: MVVM is oversold
> "How many sessions do you think there were on how to create a better user experience?"

- Are the benefits of MVVM still significant if multiple UI technologies are used?
- Custom UI elements aren't traditionally easy to unit test.
- People avoid making design decisions for the sake of testability.

### Process for its own sake: Lack of focus on users and businesses.
- We exist for users, not the other way around.
- Revisiting "pigs and chickens": Who is more likely to be using that software several hours a day for years? It's not the pigs! Possible misunderstanding of this metaphor.
> "This idea that you have to create something to show users and just cycle on it is a copout...it's not impossible to figure it out." - Inventor of Visual Basic.

> "If you wanna find out what your users' jobs are like, you need to listen and not start coding the solution five minutes into talking with them." - Billy Hollins

### Doing the wrong thing efficiently isn't much of a win
- Consider the ratio of users to developers. 30 to 1?

> "Improving the productivity of developers by 100% is less effective for the business than improving the productivity of users by 2%"

- False dichotomy: Claiming there's nothing but agile and waterfall, frequently coupled with total contempt for waterfall.
- Modern software has access to 10,000+ times the resources of existing ones. In pre-1990 software development, every feature had to be painstakingly prioritized.
- How hard it really is to do vs. How easy it looks in Microsoft demos vs year.
- Agile/Unit testing is a good solution to treat the symptoms of complex systems, but don't address the complexity itself.
- The old guard has typically thought that the new abstraction wasn't powerful enough to replace the old way of doing it that they knew and loved. e.g. VB for Windows API, FORTRAN for assembler, etc.
- Current fallacy: Thinking of the cloud as just "database servers in the sky."
- Standardization of plumbing via IaaS _reduces complexity_. 
- What if we didn't even have to think about writing plumbing code? What if we had a metadata repository with all business rules and logic, and the cloud provided all the plumbing code and a generated UI?
- If you've got all this stuff that has to be done to make an app meet the standards of "cool" software, who's gonna maintain it?

> "Those people have no business developing software."

- Microsoft LightSwitch and developer backlash against things that are too easy.
- Developer backlash against Visual Basic.

### Some recommendations
- Be skeptical and flexible.
- Decide if things work for your business and your users.
- Kick your code addiction!
- Embrace diversity.

> "In a period of rapid change, diversity is one of the attributes of a system that will help it survive."
