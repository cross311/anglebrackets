Gamify Your Work
===

Presentor: Denise Jacobs (@denisejacobs)

*Note: Full house for this presentation*

Notice that people would just come to work and then at the end of the day just go hoome, like it was just a job.  If we work in an indeustry where tens of thousands of people can use what we make, why are we being groughy people when we are at work.  If we came to work with that in mind, we will make better software and create more software that is what eople really need.

Over this presentation the game plan is to figure out how to think abot work differently!

## Start

Do you have days where when you go to work and you are watching your watch or the clock on the wall.  Is ther an alternative, or the blue pill??


Read "Reality is Broken" Jane McGonigal.  Why games make us better and how they can change the world. 

"The opposite of play isn't work, its depression."

For kids everything is learning and everyting is fun.  They hav a different perspective on life.  Everything is new.

## Game On

When you start to have low energy at work, there is a biological mechonism that will lower our energy when we are not doing something that is helpful for you.  Thnk about crisus situation you body goes into super attention mode.   This could also be used to how you work.  

Natural preference is to be challenged over boredom.  Productivity of dissipation.    No one really wants to just do nothing.  If you are bored at work and tired, it is becaue you were not being challenged.

Work vs Play:  Feedback in work is once a year, vs in a gmae feedback is constant.    Goals are contradictory or vague, where in games there are very clear.  Rules unclear and intransparent but in gaems are clear and rasparent.  

Games are fun right??  Why not make work more like games. but **WHY** **WHY** WHY.  
Playing Games is more fun than fun."  jane mcGonigal.

## Gamefulness

The use of game play mechanics for nonegame applications.

A whole bunch of itema that you an think about when you play a game.  Achieveements Levels, Infinite Gamepaly.  Owership, Status.... te list goes on.  These item are building blocks, not the whole picture.  

*Note: slides will be on slideshare*

With the building blocks come together as gaming dynamics. Suchs as Rules, parameters, time limits and players.

A lot of what keeps us from paying attention is multitasking.  hon your focus.  Pomoduro technic (30 minutes segments 25 work 5 minute rest).    Figure out some new goals.  Dont think about things a vague things.  make them quantifiable.

BANISH THE INER CRITIC.  "Inner Game Of Work"  must read.  Easier to focus on someting outside of yourself then the how to do soomething.  If you are just aping attention to the activity you will just be distracted.  Your body is really much better then your instruction part ofthe game.  Focus on the goal and intersting points af the goal.

We all have different kind of stressors, Negative stress and Eustress.  Negative is from presure of out. while Eustress is internally motivated actions like playing a raving game where you are trying to beat that time or get around the corner faster.  it is all from you not from teh outside world.

Eustress makes people feel focused adn pushes you to move forward.

Can I do this VS How can I do this?  Once of those is better, How Ca I....

Caveat to Gaming work?  Play to your strengths.  I fyou are playing to something that you are not strong at it will just bum you out, focus on your strengths. Some times it is not that you are not good at is not because you are not good at it but that you are not interested in it.

Improving on somthing that you arenot intereseted in you can only improve 10 to 15 percent and it will be painful.

## Steps??

### Commit to overcome self-chosen challenges.

Set your self up to do something that is really small and maybe even unnecessary  Think about sports.    Feedback adn mental awards

### Set-up clear goals, steps, feedbck & rewards

Figrue out ways to do this stuff for your self even if someone else has given you teh task.  It is not always there job to to give you all teh steps.

Make a better way to get feedback mor eoften, pair coding was used as an example.

rewoards, when you get to something even if the goal is really small.  Rewards like buying something (seems a little rash)  But it will trick your brain to make you addicted to teh reward.  Intermittent reenforcement.

Rewards are not moneu.  soemtimes teh reward of doing someting well.

### Keep upping the ante

dont just keep doing the same level all teh time it will stop challenging you.  If you alwas do the sme run it will just get repetitive.  You wan to feel teh rush of doing something that you have not done before.  

Embrace #fail... just because you fail does not mean to stop.  If you are correctly challenging yourself you are goign to fail.  if it is always successful try something harder.  Turn fail into a bit of feedback, no you know how you might avoid an obstical.

Fun failure is actuall energizing and adds a sense of urgentcy.  Think about easter eggs.

 Urgent Optimism: Waiting for something good is going to happen.  You will catch the ball.  Adds to your self-motivation.  add to your desire to move forward

### Make it Epic!

We are creating things that are way bigger then us.  Keep that in mind, make what you are doing more epic.  Make what you do epic, then you will put a lot more effort into it.  Medidata is doing epic things, so the work that we put into it as developers to to be epic for it!

# Tips

Curiosity is key.  always look for a new challenge.  

Create an epic meaning stement.  More like a sentance that puts what he is doing into context for what you are trying to do.  

Real-world quest.  Just like a game there should be miesones and storyline final reward.  

Minimize time to flow.  Flow states are times when you loss track of time and orget to use teh bathroom.  Gamify how long it takes you to get into flow.  Flow is good!

Blissfull productivity.  sense of being deeply ingadged into something.  "FLOW"

""Tiny Habits""  A system to change habits with baby steps.  Pick a simple behavior you wan tto change.  Find something that you do a good amount aday, then use that as a anchor point to do something.
