#Hacking the Creative Brain
#####Denise Jacobs - Tuesday 10:30-11:45

.@mentions - everyone can see!

###Intro
- Impostor syndrome as a creative
- Office conditions dampen creativity
- Flow state seems magical, but it's a set of learned behaviors
> "Creativity is all about making connections and seeing patterns." - Bruce Nussbaum
- Important to understand the mechanisms of creativity

### Emancipate & Adjust
- Distraction and Multitasking are prevalent but unquestioned!
- Zeigarnik Effect - our brains have attention loops that are constantly interrupted when we multitask
- Recognize the many forms of your inner critic
- Impostor Syndrom 
 - Hack: Know the Impostor Syndrom Paradox. You can't experience impostor syndrome unless you're qualified for what you're doing!
- Comparisons
- Procrastination (often due to perfectionism)
 - Perfectionism
- Fear of failure
 - F.E.A.R. - "False Evidence Appearing Real" or "*#$& Everything And Run!"
 - Hack: Become a fear alchemist. Turn challenges that are externally mandated into internal challenges for yourself!
 - Maintain perspective. "I can't do it. So what?"
 - Empathize
 - Reframe failure.
 - No win, no fail, just MAKE.
 
  > "Obsessing about preventingb ad things from happening also prevents good things from happening, or sometimes prevents anything from happening at all."
 
### Exercise and Adjust
- Exercise: Change your body, change your mind. Power pose! 
- Left brain is a stack, right brain is a network.
- Different brainwaves: Gamma, beta, alpha, theta, delta.
- Alpha: Gateway to creativity and super-learning.
- Hack: Breathe to refocus.
- Hack: Being prone (lie down)
- Hack: Showers
- Hack: Daydream/space out/engage in mindless activity
- The Biophilia Hyphothesis (book): Nature helps! Go outside!
- Hack: Laughter.
- Intend Alpha
- Be disciplined.

### Practice & Generate
- Delegate! Make a to don't list: 3-5 things you're not going to do anymore and dedicate that time to doing something fulfilling.
- Clean up habit fields. Move your distractions to a specific place, and go back to your work area when you're ready to work again.
- Single-tasking, say NO to distractions, rescue your time, Pomodoro, etc.
- Extensions: Leechblock, Idderall, Strict Workflow, StayFocusd
- Get a standing desk!
- Change environments
- Shape your micro-environment. Put up awesome stuff like reminders of your accomplishments.
#### Everything is a remix.
- Create constraints.
- Embrace disruption: let the idea come when it wants to.
- Focus more on curating your ideas.

### Innovate & Produce
- Do it with others
- Multiple creative people stack each others' creativity.
- Immerse yourself in diverse  environments.
- Don't keep your ideas to yourself -- share and invite others.
- Plusing, as in the Yes & structure from improv.
- Prototype
 - Don't get too attached to the initial product
 - Iterate
 - d.school production-iteration process
