Hacking The Creative Brain

## Tools For Creating

You apps your computers your office, is not what makes you creative.  What makes you creative is you brain!  

At work we have managers, clients, bureaucracy, OPRESSION is what all this adds up too.  Instead of feeling excited that you can create something you really just feel like you cant do something.

Creativity is newness producted that feels like magic, alchomey.

Creativity is about making connections and seeing patterns!  This is what a developer does everyday, developers are creative!  If you don't think creativity is not really necessary, 94% of the time that is what people are looking for!

## Mechanisms Of Creativity

Loet out you great ideas, dont just keep thinkgs in your mind and decide it is not a good idea.  You just need to get over that first hurdle.

## Emancipate & Adjust

Work culture is like a big bad game of telephone.  Thatis leaving today'swork culture with a bunch of bad habits that we cannot break.

* Distractions
* MultiTasking
 * Zeigarnik Effect: The human body has these attention loops that keep information until something is done.  However if you are multi tasking all this attention keeps splitting and splitting all your attention that just tire out your brain.  
* Communication addiction
 * you get a rush when you get a notification, and iff you ignore it you are just struggling
* Busyness
* Internalized the critical voices become monsters in your head.
 * Letting the internal monsters take over yourself will just keep you from being creative.  All this just makes you destructivity

Recognize what is this iner voice that is keeping you back.  Sometimes this idea o fthe fact that you are an imposter, that you might just be lucky they dont really know who i am.  Just know that you cannot experiance imposter syndome unless you are a badass at what you do.

Make sure that you do not keep compariing yourself to other people.  This will just turn into a huge circle of negativity.  Assume that those people are most likely struggling just as much as you.

Procrastination is the tell of perfectionism.  This all comes back to Fear of failure.  Or False Evidence Appearing Real or Fuck Everything and Run!  Thoughts on fear are just imaginations of things that are ot real.  Danger is real but fear is a choice.  Read "The year without pants".

HACK:  to become a fear alchomest -> Maintain perspective.

HACK: Empathizing with what you are doing is bigger then you.

HACK: Relook at what falure actually is. Failure is not bad.

HACK: Change you body language change you mind!  Super Woman Position.  Fake it until you make it.  Train your brain.

### Adjust Your Brain

Left vs right brain, does this change who you are or how creative you are.  Instead Left + Right == creative.

You brain is always making brain waves, what does this mean???  BETA waves: Alert concios thinking.  ALPHA: alert lucid but relaved thought.  THETA: high states of creating deep relaxation. DELTA: medidataino healing expansive awareness.

What you want to work towards is ALPHA.  To help get here is to breathe close your eyes to help refocus.  Laying down on the ground also helps move you into alpha.  Showers are also a good place to alpha state your brain.  Daydreaming is also a good way.  Engage in mindless activities helps your brain think about things (Gardening, dishes, ...).  Physical activity.  Being out in nature: Biophilia.  FINALLY LAUGH!

## Practice & Generate

To help with creativity you need to practice.  Creativity is a skill practice discipline in it.  Make sure that you are actuallyy focusing on meaningful tasks.  Delegate what you dont want to do into a list, a should not list.  Try to make a list of 3 to 5 things that you are not going to do anymore.  These things are taking up your time.

Clean up you habit fields.  "Habit Fields" on a list-a-part.  Habits are very much related t spaces.  Make sure you have a space for your creativity habit.  A way to clean up your habit field, create a new space where you do distractive stuff in a different area.  walk over to distraction area when you start to be distracted in your habit area.

SAY NO TO DISTRACTION.  30 minutes sprints: 25 minutes work 5 minutes of distraction.  Gamify this by challenging your self to do X number of sprints in a day.

Sitting is killing you.  Change you environment, you will think about things differently.

### Generate

Shape your environment to inspire your creativity.  Remember that you do not have to come up with something original, everything at this point is a remix just make it your own.  Create constaints, simplify your parameters make them smaller.  Get inspiration from children.

Just start generating ideas.  But going along with this comes with capturing the idea.  An idea can happen in the middle of the night, just write it down.

Having ideas is good. but they need to be gathered, organized, and curate your ideas.  DevInthink


## Innovate & Produce

Do it with others, dont just do it by yourself!  Ideas are better alot of the time if they are done with more people.  Immerse your self in diverse environments.  Dont just go to things that are just for your same type of people.  Maybe a meetup for zoology or something that you do not know about.

BUILDING 20 at MIT.  Avoid Sameness talk to different kinds of people.  Bring people together, actively work to bring awesome people that are awesome or interesting together.  You will become a growth for ideas.  Invite others to think about your ideas.

AMPLIFY THE IDEAS OF OTHERS!  YES&  Build on other peoples ideas make their ideas better.

### Prototype

Always tinker with your ideas, dont just let all of them sit them  Make things that you dont care if you throw them away.  You can make better stuff if you just make as many things as you can.  If you are always trying to make the best from the start yoiu will never make anything.
