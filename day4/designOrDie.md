# Design Or Die
#### Billy Hollis, Wednesday, 10:15-11:30

### Waves of Change
- Devices are multiplying like rabbits
- Users are conditioned to expect modern apps

### Motivation
- We have advanced UI tech stacks
- Every dev team should have design capability in the same way that every dev team should have database experience
- Three areas to work on
 - Design principles
 - Design process
 - Interaction and navigation patterns
- Designers excel at designing consumer apps, but they need domain knowledge to be successful line of business designers. Developers already have a great deal of this domain knowledge.
- Many modern UI platforms have no data grid
 - It's not a good interaction pattern for touch, and there are better options in the vast majority of scenarios.
- Doing a better job of data presentation and visualization is your single biggest opportunity to create productivity improvements when shifting to modern apps.

### The human visual system
- Optimized for certain types of work
- Data grid and other traditional designs require conscious scanning, parsing, and reading
- Move as much of that work as possible to the brain's GPU by using translucency, overlays, layers, shapes.

### You can observe design principles all around you in the real world
- Gestalt similarity - the visual systen groups items that are 
 - Close together
 - The same shape
 - The same color
- Fitt's law: bigger controls are faster to use
- Minimalism works (to a degree) because the brain fills in gaps
- Observe good and bad design in the real world
- Analyze them to understand the underlying design principles
- **Gutenberg diagram. People tend to start in the upper left, scan diagonally, and end at the lower right. This tendency is reversed for people who read from right to left.**
- Design depends on context, which must be taken into account.
- Users like white space and less crowded screens
 - Inattentional blindness
 - Savannah principle: people like open spaces
 - Horror vacui: fear of empty spaces often suffered by developers
- Because it's easy to generate new displays, screen real estate isn't super valuable and we can always hold off on drawing unnecessary controls.
- Progressive disclosure: Create a more compelling, less stressful, and more productive user interface.
- Context sensitive design
 - Design principles are not hard-and-fast-rules
 - Some trade off against one another
 - Need to choose based on context
- Contour bias
 - Curved shapes are associated with safety
 - Sharp shapes are more dangerous or "edgy"
- **Good design is transparent.**
- Many design principles focused on productivity
- Forgiveness (Undo buttons, not saving changes before needed to forgive mistakes "approval holding area"). Good for repetitive tasks where mistakes are problematic.

### Learning Design Principles
- Universal Principles of Design, or Designing with the Mind in Mind.
- Pluralsight course - Creating User Experiences: Fundamental Design Principles.

### Keys for Design Process
- Experimental: competing designs
- Collaborative
- Iterative
- Starts with paper: computer tools will tend to constrain you to specific shapes.

### General Process
- Understanding
 - Business needs
 - Contextual inquiry and field observation
 - Work models
- Design
 - Visioning
 - Storyboarding
 - Illustration and paper mock-up
 - Interaction prototyping
 - Evaluation
 
### Where Can You Innovate?
- Business process
- Task flow
- New capabilities
- Performance
- Location of information
- Decision support
- Error reduction
- Aesthetics
- Modularity/granularity
- Clean-up of obsolete functionality

If you can take five years to hone your craft, you can take three days to observe users.

### First time through the process is the hardest
- You'll be tempted to think small
- You must learn to let go of ideas that don't fit

Design Funnel
- Pour in lots of ideas
- Evaluate ideas, reject some
- Best ideas survive the process

### Most common mistake - single prototype/design
- Most teams do "the prototype," meaning just one
- But with one option, there's no choice!
 - Users have no reason to think very hard about it if there's only one option
 - They'll nitpick details just to satisfy you that they're listening.

### Second most common mistake - timidity
- You should aim for hte most advanced design the users will accept
- This establishes that you are entering a new world of applications
- If you are going to replace something, you must replace it with something clearly better.
- If you trim around the edges, the user will be scared you'll mess something up.
- Most Advanced Yet Acceptable - MAYA

> "Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it." - Goethe?

### Learning Design Process
- Sketching User Experiences, the workbook
- Onsite training
- Understand patterns for interaction and navigation: Option lists, galleries, launchpads, wizards, master-detail, toolbars/ribbons, dashboards, queues, configurators, timelines, metaphors, maps, viewports.

Example: Launchpad
- Can be entity centric (launches apps) or action centric, or others
- You want immediate familiarity
- Dynamic actions with no categories

Interaction patterns!!

### Hick's Law
- Every time you add a new option, you devalue all the other ones.
- Expose commonly used options, and hide less commonly used ones.
- Allowing configurability by user to include or exclude options.
