Design Or Die: The Challenge for Line-of-Business Developers
===

Presentor: Billy Hollis

The pace of change is moving at an amazing pace.  Devices are multiplying, user expect mobility, touch is expected.  Users are conditioned to expect modern apps.  While you might be a windows developer, IOS and Andriod are coming to get you.

The challenge that is lieing ahead with ios and andriod is not that it is a new technology, it is the fact that if you put your old school app on there looking the same and working the same they will spit you out.

Building advanced ui stacks exist and are very easy to pick up.  But picking up how to make a pretty application that will meet the expectations of a user, is super hard.  Presentor is not saying that every person needs to know how to do this, but at least one person on your team needs to be able to make pretty applications.

Understand you equipment.  Understand a process to make it work.  Understand what needs to be done.  You do not need to be a super star, just follow a process.

Design principles, disign process, interaction and navigation patterns.  These are things that are not going to change no matter how much time changes, the human brain will always have roots in these.  You might have to learn how to apply them differently but the patterns and princlples will stay the same.

You might think that you are not a designer.  What you see designers and what they can do you think that you can not do that.  But there is one things that you are not getting:  A designer is a consumer of what they are designing.  A designer does not normally use the types of applications that we are developing, this is where you as a developer actually have a leg up.  If you can use you knowledge about the type of data and the use of the system you will do very well.

Start thinking about what is important, not put everything in one place.  The user is going to get super tired after taking in all that information.

## Data GRIDS :(

DATA GRIDS ARE DEAD!!  Figuring out how to better show data will get you super far.  You can use layering, symbols to take advantage of the human mind that you cannot do in a data grid.

The human visual system is a computers gpu, it is really good at processing imagery information.

## Learning

How do you go about learning design principles?  The world around you is full of design principles. Gestalt similarity - visual proximity (shape, size, distance) to make things seem releated.  Your brain will fill in gaps.

If you see something that is bad or good, take a picture of it.  Take a look at why it is bad or good.

Gutenberg diagram.  people tend to scan from top left to bottom right, unless you are a reader from right ot left then it is opposite.  Shows how you will also have to take into context the action: geo, action, etc..

Users like white space and less crowed screens.  We come from a time where it was really hard to put up new screens there might have been a delay to show the stuff.  But in todays day and age bring up a new screen is super easy.  If you understand their job well enough, you can display what they need to see as they need to see it.  Start off with the important stuff and then allow them to move through the information when they need it, getting more and more descriptive.

Think about going to the ocean, does it make you feel calm?  Does your lawn buy you anything??  People enjoy open spaces.

People associate curves with safety.  Corners are sharp and dangerous.

Forgiveness.  and 75 to 80 other design principles.  Most of them you probably already know just might not know the names.  A good book: "Universal Principles of design, designing with the mind in mind".  "Designing with the mind in mind".

## Process

Experimental - competing designs.  Collaborative.  Iterative.  Starts with paper!  

We live in a world with a bunch of different ways to do one thing, designs should compete.  Not just have one person do one version and work from there.  Start from many and manage down to one.

Start with paper.  Starting with a computer will already make you start with things that you already know how to do.

Understand: 

* Business needs
* context inquiry and observation
* Work models

Design:

* Visioning
* Storyboarding
* illusrationand paper mock-up
* Interaction prototyping
* Evaluation

These are two phases that must be done in order.  How can you design something that you do not understand.

How can I innovate in the understanding phase?  Business process? task flow? new capabilities? locaiton of information?  performance  decision support?  error reduction?  aesthetics?  modularity/granularity?  clean-up?

IF YOU CAN TAKE FIVE YEARS TO HONE YOUR CRAFT, YOU CAN TAKE 5 MINUTES TO KNOW YOUR USERS

## First Time

Youll be tempted to think small.  You must learn to let go of ideas that dont fit.  You are much more likely to come up with good ideas from a bunch of ideas.  Pour in a bunch of ideas, evaluate, allow the best to come out.

Most teams do THE PROTOTYPE, meaning just one.  With one option there is only one choice.  users have no reason to think very ablout the one options.  they wll nitpick details just to satisfy you that they are listening.  Going with more then one prototype will cut down on the crazy destruction of what your protype is trying to accomplish.

## SEcond Time

You should aim fo rhte ost advanced design the user will accept.  you only do this every so ofter so go way out.  This estabilishes that you are entering a new world of applications.  I fyou ar egoing to replace somehting, you must replace it ith something clearly better!!!

Most advaced yet acceptable.  Minor refinements dont excite anyone.  BOLDNES HAS GENIUS POWER AND MAGIC IN IT!  fifteen years ago the presentor would not have said this, but now YES.

"Sketching the user experiences.  the workbook"  Suggested starting point for learnign the process.

**understand patterns**  The mobile pattern design gallery, is a book the presentor brought up.  

Launchpad: Action centric, Entity Centric, Application Centric.  MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT OVER DO IT.  Expose commonly used options.  the more options the more you devalue the other options.
