### Introduction

This is about Art, the idea.  For today Art is defined by if you say it is Art it is Art.

### Main

#### Art Vs Visualization

What is data art VS data visualiation.  Both are about investigation of data, they are both similar.  The materials are the same but the kind of data that is used are different. Vis is more comprehensive, while art is more fragmented and incomplete.  Visualization is to tell a story about what the data can inform you about.  Art is about expressing your feelings not exactly a informatic take away.

#### WHY IS DATA ART AWESOME

- understand yourself
- understand a system
- Expand your horizon
- having fun

#### Examples Are Awesome

Books As Data As Art

Literary Approach: data vis does not always allow you to connect with the data. Where do I fit in?  But if you look at books while there is a lot of data you still are able to find a character that you simpathize with.  There has to be a way to bring the connectedness of a book to data Art.

A Day in the life:

A map showing a taxi drivers paths and life for a day.

Language As Data: Two.js and Web Audio.
